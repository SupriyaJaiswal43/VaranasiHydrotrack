 üåç Water Quality Monitoring and Geocoding Application

This project is a Water Quality Monitoring and Geocoding Application that provides a comprehensive platform for mapping, visualizing, and analyzing water quality data. It leverages the power of OpenStreetMap, Nominatim, and Chart.js to offer users an interactive experience for submitting, visualizing, and interpreting water quality metrics.



 üöÄ Features

- Geocoding Functionality: Converts user-provided addresses into geographic coordinates using the Nominatim service from OpenStreetMap.
- Water Quality Data Integration: Users can submit water quality data (pH, turbidity, contaminant levels, etc.) via a user-friendly form.
- Interactive Map: Visualizes water quality data on a map with clustering techniques to avoid clutter and provide insights into regional trends.
- Pollution Reporting: Users can report water quality pollution incidents directly on the map by selecting the location.
- Data Visualization: Display water quality trends over time using charts powered by Chart.js.
- Document Submission: Upload and store documents related to water quality incidents.

 üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Database: MongoDB (Spatial indexing for quick location-based queries)
- Geospatial Mapping: OpenStreetMap, Nominatim API, Leaflet.js
- Data Visualization: Chart.js

 üìã Project Setup

 Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v12 or higher)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) installed locally or an online MongoDB service (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)

 Installation
